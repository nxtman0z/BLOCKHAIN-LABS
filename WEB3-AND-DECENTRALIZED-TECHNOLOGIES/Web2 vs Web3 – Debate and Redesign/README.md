This lab explores the **evolution of the internet**, comparing Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0, with a focus on **data ownership, privacy, and identity management**.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- **Web 1.0** – Static, read-only web with limited interaction.  
- **Web 2.0** – Interactive, user-generated content, but centralized and ad-driven.
