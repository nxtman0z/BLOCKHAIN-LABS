# Build DeFi - AMM or Lending Prototype 

This lab demonstrates building a basic **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** using Solidity, where two ERC-20 tokens can be swapped and liquidity can be added/removed.

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Created and deployed two ERC-20 tokens (e.g., **TOBI** and **MAD**) using Solidity.  
2. Imported both tokens into **MetaMask** via contract addresses.  
3. Wrote and compiled an **AMM smart contract** with functions for:  
   - Adding liquidity  
   - Removing liquidity  
   - Swapping between TokenA and TokenB  
4. Deployed the AMM contract on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet.  
5. Approved the AMM contract to spend both tokens via MetaMask.  
6. Added liquidity and performed token swaps.  
7. Verified all transactions on **Etherscan**.  

## ✅ Observations
- ERC-20 tokens were successfully deployed and appeared in MetaMask.  
- AMM contract correctly handled liquidity provision.  
- Swap transactions executed successfully with updated balances.  
- All actions confirmed on the Ethereum test network.
