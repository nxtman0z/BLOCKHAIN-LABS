# Store with IPFS - Decentralized File Upload 

This lab demonstrates how to upload files to **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** using **Pinata** with backend and frontend integration.

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Logged in to **Pinata** via Brave Browser.  
2. (Optional) Generated an API key for backend uploads.  
3. Created a project folder and opened it in **VS Code**.  
4. Added `.env` (for API keys) and `addfile.js` / `server.js` files for backend code.  
5. Initialized project with `npm init -y`.  
6. Wrote backend code to securely upload files to Pinata.  
7. Created `App.jsx` frontend to connect and upload files.  
8. Uploaded files → received **IPFS hash** → verified on Pinata dashboard.  

## ✅ Observations
- Files were uploaded successfully to **Pinata** and returned unique **IPFS hashes**.  
- IPFS hashes can be used globally via any IPFS gateway to access the files.  
- Backend integration with `.env` ensured **API keys remained secure**.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
