# Connect the Dots - Ethers.js and MetaMask UI 

This lab demonstrates creating a **decentralized application (DApp)** by deploying a `SimpleStorage.sol` smart contract on Ethereum Sepolia Testnet and connecting it with a **React frontend** using **Ethers.js**.

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Wrote and compiled `SimpleStorage.sol` in **Remix IDE**.  
2. Deployed the contract to **Sepolia Testnet** using **MetaMask**.  
3. Copied the **ABI** and **contract address**.  
4. Created a **React project** (`create-react-app`) and added ABI & address in `.env`.  
5. Installed **ethers.js** for blockchain interaction.  
6. Developed UI in `App.js` to **store and retrieve data**.  
7. Styled frontend with CSS and ran project with `npm start`.  

## ✅ Observations
- Contract was deployed successfully and integrated with frontend.  
- **Ethers.js** simplified wallet connection and contract calls.  
- The DApp allows users to **update and check stored values** easily.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
