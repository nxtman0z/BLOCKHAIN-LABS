# Wallet Walkthrough - Hands-on Wallet Setup 

This lab demonstrates the process of creating a **cryptographic wallet** for blockchain interactions using a browser wallet extension.

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Installed **Core Wallet** extension in the browser.  
2. Selected **Create Wallet Manually** option.  
3. Set wallet name and password.  
4. Successfully created a new wallet.  

## ✅ Observations
- A wallet is based on a **public/private key pair** for blockchain identity.  
- Wallets don’t store coins directly, but store keys to access blockchain assets.  
- **Private keys** must be kept secret, while **public keys** can be shared to receive funds.
