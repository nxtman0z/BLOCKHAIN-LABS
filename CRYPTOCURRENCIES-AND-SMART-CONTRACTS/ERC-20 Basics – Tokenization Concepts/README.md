# ERC-20 Basics - Tokenization Concepts 



This lab demonstrates the creation, deployment, and testing of an **ERC-20 token** on Ethereum using **Remix IDE** and **MetaMask**.

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Created a Solidity file in Remix (e.g., `tobi.sol`).  
2. Wrote an ERC-20 token contract using **OpenZeppelin**.  
3. Compiled the contract (Solidity v0.8.20).  
4. Deployed the contract with **Injected Provider – MetaMask**.  
5. Verified the deployed contract on **Etherscan**.  
6. Imported the token into MetaMask (1,000,000 supply).  
7. Executed **token transfers** to another wallet and confirmed on Etherscan.  

## ✅ Observations
- Contract compiled and deployed successfully.  
- Token appeared in MetaMask after import.  
- Transfers worked correctly and were verified on Etherscan.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Remix IDE  
- MetaMask  
- Etherscan  
- OpenZeppelin Contracts
