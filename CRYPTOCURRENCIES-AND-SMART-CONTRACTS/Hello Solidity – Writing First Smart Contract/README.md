 
# Hello Solidity – Writing First Smart Contract

This lab introduces writing and deploying a **basic Solidity smart contract** (`SimpleStorage.sol`) using **Remix IDE** and **MetaMask** on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet.

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Installed and set up **MetaMask wallet**.  
2. Collected test ETH from **Sepolia Faucet**.  
3. Opened **Remix IDE** and created `SimpleStorage.sol`.  
4. Wrote a simple contract with **get()** and **set()** functions.  
5. Compiled the contract using Solidity Compiler.  
6. Deployed the contract via **Injected Provider – MetaMask**.  
7. Verified deployment by calling the contract functions.  

## ✅ Observations
- Contract successfully compiled and deployed to Sepolia Testnet.  
- MetaMask handled transactions and confirmed them on-chain.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- MetaMask Wallet  
- Remix IDE  
- Ethereum Sepolia Faucet  
- Brave Browser
