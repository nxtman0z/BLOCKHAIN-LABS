# Know Your TX - Dissecting a Transaction 


This lab focuses on analyzing and understanding the details of a blockchain transaction using **Etherscan**.

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Obtained a **Transaction Hash (TX Hash)** from MetaMask or Remix.  
2. Searched the TX Hash on **Etherscan**.  
3. Analyzed transaction details including:  
   - From / To addresses  
   - Gas used & Gas price  
   - Block number & Timestamp  
   - Nonce & Status  
   - Value transferred & Input data  
4. Observed how miners validate and include transactions in blocks.  

## ✅ Observations
- Every blockchain transaction has a unique **TX Hash**.  
- Transaction details are **transparent and publicly visible**.  
- Once confirmed, transactions are **immutable** and permanently stored on the blockchain.
