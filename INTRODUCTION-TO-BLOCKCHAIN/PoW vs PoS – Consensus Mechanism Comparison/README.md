# PoW vs PoS - Consensus Mechanism Comparison 

# Proof of Work (PoW) vs Proof of Stake (PoS)

This project explores and compares two major blockchain consensus mechanisms: **Proof of Work (PoW)** and **Proof of Stake (PoS)**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Contents
- Definitions of PoW and PoS  
- Working steps of each mechanism  
- Comparison on key factors (energy, security, speed, cost)  
- Conclusion on efficiency and security  

## âš¡ Consensus Mechanisms

### Proof of Work (PoW)
- Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles.  
- Requires high computational power and energy.  
- Provides strong security through mining difficulty.  

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Validators are chosen based on staked cryptocurrency.  
- Energy-efficient and faster than PoW.  
- Validators risk losing stake if acting maliciously.  

## ðŸ”Ž Key Comparison
| Feature            | PoW                      | PoS                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Energy Consumption | High                     | Low                          |
| Security           | 51% hash power attack    | 51% stake attack             |
| Speed              | Slower                   | Faster                       |
| Cost               | Expensive hardware + energy | Requires cryptocurrency stake |

## âœ… Conclusion
- **PoW** ensures strong security but at the cost of high energy consumption.  
- **PoS** provides efficiency, scalability, and better environmental impact.
