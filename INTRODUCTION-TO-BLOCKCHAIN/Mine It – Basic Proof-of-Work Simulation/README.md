# Mine It - Basic Proof-of-Work Simulation 

# ⛏️ Proof of Work Simulator – Blockchain Mining Demo  

This project demonstrates the concept of blockchain mining and the Proof of Work consensus mechanism using an online simulator.  

## 🔹 Steps Performed  
1. Opened the Proof of Work Simulator in a web browser.  
2. Mined Block #1 until a valid hash with leading zeros was found.  
3. Sequentially mined Block #2, Block #3, and Block #4, maintaining blockchain integrity.  
4. Modified block data to observe how tampering breaks the chain.  
5. Reset the simulator to repeat the process and reinforce learning.  

## 📌 Outcome  
✅ Successfully mined all blocks with valid hashes.  
✅ Demonstrated how data changes affect the blockchain’s validity.  
✅ Understood the role of mining in maintaining blockchain security.
