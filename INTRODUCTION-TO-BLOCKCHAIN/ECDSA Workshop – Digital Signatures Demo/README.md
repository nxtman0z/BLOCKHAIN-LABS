# ECDSA Workshop - Digital Signatures Demo 

This repository contains a PDF report on **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**, a cryptographic technique widely used in Bitcoin and other blockchain systems for securing transactions through digital signatures.

## 📄 Contents
- Overview of ECDSA  
- Key Generation (Private & Public Keys)  
- Digital Signature Process (Sign & Verify)  
- Observations on Security and Usage in Bitcoin  

## 🔑 Key Points
- ECDSA uses elliptic curve mathematics for secure key generation and digital signatures.  
- A private key is a large random number, while the public key is derived from it using elliptic curve multiplication.  
- Digital signatures prove ownership of the private key without exposing it.  
- Verification ensures authenticity using only the public key, message hash, and signature.  
- Reusing the same nonce in signing can compromise security.  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Brave Web Browser  
- Text Editor  
- [Learn Me A Bitcoin – ECDSA](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/cryptography/elliptic-curve/ecdsa)

## 📌 Usage
This document can be used as a reference for understanding the basics of ECDSA, its implementation, and its role in securing cryptocurrency transactions.
