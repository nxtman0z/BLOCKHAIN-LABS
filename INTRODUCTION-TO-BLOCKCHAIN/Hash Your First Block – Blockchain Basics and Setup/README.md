# Lab 1 – Hash Your First Block: Blockchain Basics and Setup

## Objective
Understand the fundamentals of a blockchain block, how hashing works, and how changes to data affect the hash.

## Steps
1. Visit the [Blockchain Demo](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/blockchain).
2. Observe attributes: **Block Number**, **Nonce**, **Data**, **Previous Hash**, and **Hash**.
3. Explore the **Genesis Block** (first block with no previous hash).
4. Add some data and click **Mine** to generate a valid hash.
5. Observe how changing data triggers the **Avalanche Effect** (hash changes completely).
6. For blockchain chains, notice how blocks are interconnected and how altering one block affects the rest.

## Observations
- The Genesis Block has no Previous Hash (all zeros).
- Adding data changes the block’s hash and all subsequent block hashes.
- Mining recalculates the hash and nonce to match the difficulty.
- Demonstrates how blockchains maintain integrity through linking hashes.

## Tools Used
- **Website:** [Blockchain Demo](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/blockchain)

## Final Output
After mining, each block shows a valid hash matching its data and nonce.
