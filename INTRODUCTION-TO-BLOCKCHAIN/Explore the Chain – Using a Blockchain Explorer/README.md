# 🔍 Bitcoin Blockchain Explorer – Transaction & Block Analysis  

This project demonstrates how to use a blockchain explorer to analyze Bitcoin transactions, wallet addresses, and blocks.  

## 🔹 Steps Performed  
1. Opened a Bitcoin blockchain explorer (e.g., blockchain.com).  
2. Searched by transaction hash (TXID) to view transaction details.  
3. Checked sender and receiver addresses, amount, fees, and status.  
4. Viewed wallet balance and transaction history using a wallet address.  
5. Explored block details including hash, miner, transactions, and timestamp.  

## 📌 Outcome  
✅ Successfully located and analyzed Bitcoin transactions using TXID.  
✅ Verified transaction inclusion in a block with confirmation details.  
✅ Explored inputs, outputs, and block metadata for deeper blockchain insights.
