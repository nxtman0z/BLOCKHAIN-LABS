# React Start - DApp Frontend Scaffolding 


This lab demonstrates building a **full-stack DApp** by deploying a `SimpleStorage.sol` smart contract on Ethereum Sepolia Testnet and connecting it with a **React frontend** using **Ethers.js**.

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Wrote and compiled `SimpleStorage.sol` in **Remix IDE**.  
2. Deployed the contract on **Sepolia Testnet** using **MetaMask**.  
3. Copied **ABI** and **contract address** for frontend integration.  
4. Created a **React project** (`create-react-app`) and stored ABI & address in `.env`.  
5. Installed **ethers.js** to connect frontend with the contract.  
6. Built UI in `App.js` to **store and retrieve values**.  
7. Styled frontend with CSS and ran with `npm start`.  

## ✅ Observations
- Contract was deployed successfully and interacted with through frontend.  
- **Ethers.js** made wallet connection and contract function calls more secure and simpler.  
- Users can **update and retrieve stored values** using the DApp.
